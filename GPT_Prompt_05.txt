  "A customer wants to talk with their account manager. Can you please arrange for a manager to reach out to them?"

  "We are facing a problem described in the ticket XYZ. Can you please look into this?"

    "Provide troubleshooting information and access."

• Here are some examples of MEANINGLESS last response:
  The response is only an acknowledgement without any useful information:
    "Let me get back on this."
    "Noted."
    "We are checking."
    "We will get back to you soon."
  The response is a question that is probing or discussing with other team members AND contains no useful infromation that could be shared with the customer:
    "Jim, can you look into this?"
    "Can someone look into this? Sarah?"
    "Ali, can you check on this and reach out to the customer?"
    "Sarah, how can we take this forwward?"

    The response is a followup message, remininding the recepient to respondto an earlier request.
